# GPT-anki-helper

## Getting Started

The app generates questions and answers pairs, and saves them exclusively, that means that any text that is not marked with Q: and A: at the begininng wont be saved to the the deck
Currently the desktop app works only on windows. Future releases will support MacOS.

### Installation

You need to go to the "[realeases](https://github.com/GingerAle3101/GPT-anki-helper/releases)" page, then click on the link called *GPT_Anki_Helper.zip*

Once you have downloaded it you *need* to extract the .exe file, better to do it inside another separate folder since the program will create some other files inside the same directory it is opened.


Then you just, use the app!

### Usage

First you enter your OpenAi API key, you can find it inside your [OpenAi platform homepage](https://platform.openai.com/), you create your account and then look for "view API keys" inside your profile menu (right upper corner). Once you got your API key you have to set it with the "Enter API key" button shown below:

You choose a text, you copy it inside the first text box like above.
You click the "GPT" button and check the response->

If the response is good, then you click "add" to add it to your deck, and once you have   *   all   *   your pairs added, you click "generate" to generate the anki package file (.apkg) that you will be able to open inside anki

    DO NOT REMOVE THE Q: AND A: MARKERS 
    OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WONT SAVE THE TEXT 
    NEXT TO THE MARKERS
